<p>In this project I created the login and messaging into one application.  I created loops for the login in the case of an incorrect login number or password.  I also created loops for the messaging portion that will allow a user to add profiles to the account, along with posting from each profile multiple times (limited to 6).</p>
<p>I created while loops to allow each profile to post multiple times, and display each post within the console log.</p>
<p>I have created commits within git hub that contain changes made within the coding, for both the messaging & login, and for this html file.</p>
